                        On May 7th, 2022, I traveled to her school to wish her a happy birthday and make the day special as a return birthday gift. She was so excited and surprised that I would take the risk of traveling for her birthday. Before making the trip, I consulted two of my friends to ensure it was the right move. In my heart, Iâ€™ve always been careful not to send any wrong signals or toy with a lady's feelings and mind. I just wanted to be a good friend and brother.

                From the moment we met, I knew there was something uniquely
                special about you. Your smile, your laughter, and the way you see
                the world captured my heart and soul. As we embark on this
                beautiful journey towards our wedding day, I want to share just
                how much you mean to me. You are my confidant, my partner, and my
                best friend. Your unwavering support and unconditional love have
                been the cornerstone of our relationship. Together, we've faced
                life's challenges and celebrated its triumphs, always emerging
                stronger and more deeply connected. Your kindness and generosity
                of spirit inspire me every day. You have a way of seeing the best
                in people and bringing out the best in me. Your passion for life
                and your boundless optimism make every day brighter and every
                moment sweeter. As we prepare to exchange our vows, I am filled
                with immense joy and gratitude. I am grateful for the love we've
                nurtured, the memories we've created, and the future we are
                building together. I look forward to a lifetime of shared dreams,
                adventures, and countless moments of happiness. Thank you for
                being my rock, my safe haven, and my greatest love. I am honored
                to soon call you my spouse and to spend the rest of my life with
                you by my side. With all my love.
